# Full Stack GPT Portfolio Project

This project is built based on Streamlit.

## Python Version
This project requires Python 3.11.6 or later.

## Getting Started

It is recommended to create a virtual environment (venv) for this project. You can create venv by using `python -m venv venv`.
Then activate the virtual environment using the following commands:
    - On Windows:
        `venv\Scripts\actiave`
    - On macOS/Linux:
        `source venv/bin/activate`


To install requirements, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run the application with `streamlit run Home.py`.

PrivateGPT requires Ollama and Mistral model downloaded. The model differs with DocumentGPT by being able to run without internet access.
